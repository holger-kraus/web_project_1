# Learning how to learn

## Web Development course at Yandex Practicum
I am participating in an excellent web development course at [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/) right now.
You get a very good introduction into many web develompent topics on their learning platform. After mastering the 
according lessons, you have to proof your newly acquired skills in your own projects. 

## My first project
This is my first project that I have implemented as part of the course. It is focused on the correct use of HTML
and CSS. It doesn't use any javascript.

### Functionality

The web site that I have developed is a nice entry point to different learning techniques and methodologies and also 
shows some interesting facts and figures about learning in general.

It covers and mentions the following topics:
* The main problem with education
* Five learning strategies from Barbara Oakley
* The first 20 hours - how to learn anything. 
* Inside the mind of a master procrastinator
* Barbara Oakley’s story.
* The Feynman technique
* Facts and figures about learning and the brain
* The One World Schoolhouse
* Ten principles of rapid skill acquisition
* Some hints for further resources

### Technologies

In detail the following technologies and methods have been used:
* Semantic HTML like
    * sections
    * header
    * footer
    * main area
    * headlines
    * paragraphs
    * lists
    * links
* BEM Methodology (Block, Element, Modifier)
    * How to organize CSS сlasses
    * How to organize CSS files
* CSS techniques like
    * box model
    * flexbox
    * positioning
    * embedding videos via iFrames
    * transformations
    * animations

## What is still open

The web site contains some empty links, because the according sites don't exist yet. For example the feynman technique
just mentioned, but their is no detail page for it.

Another thing that should we done. The link for buying the book "The One World Schoolhouse" is also empty. Implementing
 a page where you could buy the book would be a nice opportunity to show how to use and style HTML forms. They were introduced in the course, but didn't
had to be used in the project.

When will I do it? I have no idea right now, because the course and other project keep me busy. 
What maybe we continue working on this, who knows.
